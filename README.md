# ToDoList
ToDoList App created with JavaScript

I've created this app for helping me get tasks done in work in more organized way. The app is simple - input and button, when you type something into the input and press the button the value that you wrote will be saved into your browsers local storage and it will be added into the site as an HTML element with checkbox and delete button. When you tick the checkbox, the task will be crossed but will not dissapear. It will only dissapear when you click on the delete button, which will also delete it from local storage of your browser.

In the future, I want to add categories for tasks, dates when you have to finish them (optional) and option for setting reminders.
